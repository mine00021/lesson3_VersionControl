            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control System is also called Revision Control or Source Control System. It has one main repository to store all the project files you need. Also, it is not just for one person to access this system, but for a group of people to access it. Thus, it is benefical to work in a project with team. Furthermore, each team member could access the same file at the same time, and they can make changes to their own files, then check them back in. This could organize the files well and people could check each file that is modifed in order to track their status. Moreover, this system allows users to rever back to the old version if they need. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three main types of version control system: Local Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control Systems, and Distributed Version Control Systems. Local Version Control Systems is what many people usually do. They just copy their files into a version database. Users then could track each version of their files. Centralized Version Control Systems is for those people need to work with others on other systems. This system has a server that store all the files and users could check out the files from this place. However, if there is something wrong with this server, all the users could not access to the files. This issue also happens in Local Version Control Systems. For Distributed Version Control Systems, there are multiple servers in this system. So if one of the servers collapes, then users could also access to other database to check out the files. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of the distributed version control system. By using Git, users could work online and offline. Users could create local brances as much as they want in order to organize from small files to large projects with team members. Unlike other storage system, Git treats files as data, and take a snapshot every time you commit and save your files. Moreover, if there is no any changes of your files, Git would not store them again, but create a link to the previous one. Also, because Git is a distributed system, you could have a local database to access your files, instead of checking out from the remote server, which would save your a lot of time.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Three States and Sections of a Git Project</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three main states that your files can reside in, including committed, modified and staged. Committed tells your files are saved in your local database. Modified indicates that your files have been changed and not stored to your database. Stages shows that your changed files have been marked, they are waited for your to commit to the database. Thus, these three states leads to three sections when working on Git: Git directory, staging area, and working directory. Users could revise their files in the working directory. After that, they could stage their files to the staging area. At the final step, they could commite their files to the Git directory, which means files are stored successfully. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are four status of your files: untracked, unmodified, modified, and staged. If users want to check the status of their files, they can use the git status command. This command also tells the users that how many branches they have. Moreover, it tells you what untracked files you have. If a user want to track a new file, they could use the git add command. When a user finishes modifying a file, they should use the git add command again. So the file can be staged in the working directory. Users may think that git status is a little bit comlicated. They can use the git status command to get a simplified output. They should know that the "A" in the output means the files have been staged and the "M" indicates that the files have been modified.</p>
